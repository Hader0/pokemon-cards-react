# React + Vite


- WANT: Create a Favourite's Button for users to click to see their saved/favourited cards.

- FIX: the search issues that for some reason, don't allow me to search for "Walking Wake", even though it can be searched by entering "Walking" or "Wake". 

- MAYBE: Render cards that match slightly misspelt names
