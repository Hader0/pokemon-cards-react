# Pokemon Card Search


- WANT: Create a little info text above/to the side of the favourite cards icon to display "Favourite Cards". 
- WANT: Create an alternative favourite cards button for users on mobile.
- WANT: Create a button somewhere discrete to allow the user to change the theme of the website.

- FIX: the search issues that for some reason, don't allow me to search for "Walking Wake", even though it can be searched by entering "Walking" or "Wake". 

- MAYBE: Render cards that match slightly misspelt names.
